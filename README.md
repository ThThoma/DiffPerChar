# DiffPerChar

Easily compare two strings and visualize the differences on a per-character basis using this straightforward, single-file HTML tool.

## URL Arguments

Customize input texts and column names through the URL parameters:
- `textA=`
- `textB=`
- `columnA=`
- `columnB=`

Example:

```html
https://ththoma.github.io/DiffPerChar/?textA=hello&&textB=world&&columnA=A&&columnB=B
```

### Why Use DiffPerChar?
During a project where I managed user values in text format and needed to identify differences, I found myself manually comparing strings without a character-by-character difference tool. Unable to find a similar solution, I decided to create one.


### Licensing
This tool is open source, and you are free to do as you please with it. Modify the single HTML file as needed to suit your requirements. The primary goal is simplicity.
